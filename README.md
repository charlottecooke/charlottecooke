### Oh hey! 😄

My name is Charlotte and I am a ex-Physicist turned full stack software developer 🛰 🔬 💻
currently working in Amsterdam in the Netherlands 🇳🇱�

I am interested in helping out on open source eco friendly projects or projects related to social justice / equality in my free time
so hit me up if you have something like that you need help with! ☮️

Tech that I use regularly and know a bit about:
Typescript, NodeJS, React, K8s, Docker, Terraform, lots of AWS things, Travis and Jenkins fun! SQL and a few other bits and bobs

Looking to learn / in the process of learning about:
Java, ElasticStack, Machine Learning -> Natural Language Processing (just like everyone else under the sun 🌞)

Aside from all the techy stuff, mental and physical wellbeing is important to me
so I like to meditate, do yoga, run, learn languages, learn guitar, read and enjoy the good things in life,
like a really nice glass of red wine sitting in the sun 🍷
